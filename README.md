Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This program is a grocery store item tracking program, solving the problem of analizing the raw data from grocery purchases, giving a histogram view and normal view of the frequencies each item is bought

What did you do particularly well?
  I think the code is pretty well organized, uses good comments, and the code is very clear what does what by the use of a class structure.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I could definitely make the code faster and be more usable for extremely large data sets, currently the code is not optimized for very large data sets.
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The most challenging part for me was the try/catch parts for then input validation, I just did not previously have extensive use of them and it took a little practice to get right. Using the CPP reference website really helped me with resources to help me with this
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  This project was espeically useful for learning the correct way to develop applications for larger scale applications, using code practices useful for collaboration and working as part of a team.
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
 I used a class structure so that each part of the program is modular and can be updated without having to edit all of the code. I also use extensive commenting and readable code practices to make it as easy as possible to understand.
